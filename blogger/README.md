# Introduction

This repo builds a blog system following the tutorial at http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/blogger.html
and was made as part of Web Development 101 curriculum at The Odin Project.

# To Dos
At some point, go back and do the Extras sections I6:
* Add a site-wide sidebar that holds navigation links
* Create date-based navigation links. For instance, there would be a list of links with the names of the months and when you click on the month it shows you all the articles published in that month.
* Track the number of times an article has been viewed. Add a view_count column to the article, then in the show method of articles_controller.rb just increment that counter. Or, better yet, add a method in the article.rb model that increments the counter and call that method from the controller.
* Once you are tracking views, create a list of the three "most popular" articles
* Create a simple RSS feed for articles using the respond_to method and XML view templates
